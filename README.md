# Mobile Eye Gaze Estimation with Deep Learning

In the final project for the "Introduction to Deep Learning" class at RPI (Spring 2017), I have trained a convolutional neural network to estimate the eye gaze of a person as they look at their mobile device. Eye gaze estimation refers to determining an accurate prediction of the direction and/or specific position of where a person is looking at, on a phone/tablet screen. The Input to this model is the face-image of a person as captured by the front-facing camera on their mobile device; and the output is the 2D position (x, y) on the screenâ€™s surface.

The original dataset comes from the GazeCapture project: http://gazecapture.csail.mit.edu/

Due to limitations in computing power, in an academic setting, our data set consists 48000 training
samples and 5000 validation samples. Each sample has 3 images and a mask. There are, images of (1)
the left eye, (2)the right eye and (3) the face. Each of the 3 images (in each sample) has 3 channels
(RGB) and dimensions, 64x64. Also provided, is a 25x25 face-mask that is a binary grid input that
indicates the location and size of the head within a frame.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For this project, you need to have python 3.5 and the tensorflow python library v1.4 installed. A good link for setting up your machine can be found here for Ubuntu 16.04:
