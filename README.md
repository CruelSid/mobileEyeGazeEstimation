# Mobile Eye Gaze Estimation with Deep Learning

In the final project for the \Introduction to Deep Learning" class at RPI (Spring 2017), I have trained a convolutional neural network to estimate the eye gaze of a person as they look at their mobile device. Eye gaze
estimation refers to determining an accurate prediction of the direction and/or specific position of where
a person is looking at, on a phone/tablet screen. The Input to this model is the face-image of a person
as captured by the front-facing camera on their mobile device; and the output is the 2D position (x; y)
on the screenâ€™s surface.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
